### Pipeline Overview
Our automated pipeline, endorsed by neuroscience experts Prof. Leonard White (Duke) and Prof. Robert Williams (Chair, UT), offers efficient and tailored data processing for Alzheimer's Disease research. It efficiently generates customized subvolumes, applies machine learning-based segmentation, and quantifies objects, using ImarisXT and Fiji. Capable of processing a specimen with ~ 30 customized brain regions in **under 10 minutes**, our pipeline is not only swift but also flexibly adapts to various regions.
